/**
 * A scroll pane that respects the desired scroll offset of client views that
 * implement {@link StickyScrollable}.  This allows components to do things
 * like keep themselves scrolled to the bottom as their size changes.
 * <p>
 * The conventional way of doing this is by	queueing a {@link Runnable} to
 * call {@link JComponent#scrollRectToVisible(Rectangle)}.  But this approach
 * often causes the scroll bars to be painted at the original viewport
 * position before being painted again at the new position, resulting in
 * "bouncing" scroll bar knobs.  This class adjusts the viewport position
 * while laying out the scroll pane, so the scroll bars are painted only once
 * and the knobs do not bounce.
